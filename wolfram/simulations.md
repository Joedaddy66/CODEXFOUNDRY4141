# Wolfram Language Simulations and Models

This directory contains Wolfram Language notebooks and scripts for advanced numerical simulations and modeling related to the Doctrine of Frequency.

## Current Simulations:
* High-fidelity Bond Strength mapping for extended numerical ranges.
* Complex Fourier analysis of prime distributions and numerical sequences.
* Simulations of resonance zones and interference patterns.
