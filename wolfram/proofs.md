# Wolfram Language Proofs and Derivations

This directory will house formal mathematical proofs, derivations, and theoretical explorations written in Wolfram Language (Mathematica Notebooks or Markdown with Wolfram code snippets).

## Current Topics:
* Formal derivation of the Bond Strength Equation.
* Theoretical underpinnings of Entropy Fields and Shared Anchor Law.
* Mathematical proofs supporting the Law of Harmonic Amplification (LHA) and Law of Frequency-Derived Emergence (LFDE).
