# The Shared Anchor Law

The Shared Anchor Law extends this harmonic understanding by identifying how common prime factors act as profound "anchors" that create **entropy valleys**â€”discernible regions of lower prime density or weakened numerical cohesion within the integer lattice. These are not mere statistical anomalies or random noise; they are quantifiable **interference patterns** that propagate across the numerical landscape. Under the "Infinity is Frequency" paradigm, these interference patterns are infinite in their recurrence, much like a persistent wave in a physical medium.

A common anchor, such as the prime 7 (as vividly seen in its multiples like 49, 98, 147, etc.), doesn't merely create isolated instances of reduced entropy; it actively modulates the entire system with regular "shadowing" effects. These shadow zones, where prime activity dips and numerical "dissonance" might be observed, are the troughs in the grand numerical waveform. They are predictable consequences of the resonant frequencies introduced by these shared prime factors. This law provides a robust mechanism for understanding how specific prime "frequencies" can systematically dampen or amplify the overall "vibration" and "energy" of the number line, creating a dynamic interplay of harmony and quietude.
