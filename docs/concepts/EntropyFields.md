# Entropy Fields

**Entropy Fields** describe regions within the numerical continuum where the inherent order and predictability of numerical patterns are diminished or disrupted. These are not zones of pure randomness, but rather areas where **harmonic dissonance** or destructive interference patterns dominate. Such fields can manifest as lower prime density, weakened factor relationships, or less discernible structural recurrences. They represent the "troughs" or "quiet zones" in the numerical symphony, where the overall "vibration" is dampened.
