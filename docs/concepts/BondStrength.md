# Bond Strength (BS)

**Bond Strength** is a quantifiable metric representing the **amplitude of a number's inherent harmonic resonance**. It is not merely a measure of a number's factors, but a score reflecting the internal digital harmony and structural cohesion derived from the interplay of its prime constituents. Higher Bond Strength indicates a more coherent and amplified numerical "vibration," signifying a stronger, more predictable pattern within the numerical field. It is the numerical equivalent of a louder, clearer tone in a complex waveform.
