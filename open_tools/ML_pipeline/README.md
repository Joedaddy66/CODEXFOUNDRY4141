# Machine Learning Pipelines for the Harmonic Codex

This directory contains Python scripts for machine learning experiments related to the Doctrine of Frequency. These pipelines aim to discover new wave-encoded rules of numerical generation and interaction by analyzing Bond Strength sequences and resonance profiles.

## Current Focus:
* Predicting Bond Strength based on numerical properties.
* Identifying patterns in prime distribution through harmonic analysis.

## Getting Started:
(Future instructions for running pipelines, data preparation, and model training will go here.)
