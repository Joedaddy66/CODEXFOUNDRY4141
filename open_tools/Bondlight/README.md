# BondLightâ„¢ â€“ Tactile Resonance Module

This module is designed to translate the abstract concept of numerical Bond Strength into tangible, luminous patterns. It aims to create a physical manifestation of the Law of Harmonic Amplification, allowing for an intuitive understanding of the underlying frequencies of the number line.

## Project Structure:
- `firmware/`: Embedded code for the BondLight cubes.
- `data/`: Datasets for bond strength mappings and color logic.
- `docs/`: Design documents, theory, and specifications.
- `marketing/`: User scenarios and product messaging.
- `simulations/`: Tools for visualizing waveforms and patterns.

## Purpose:
To provide a tactile and visual interface for exploring the harmonic ontology of mathematics.
