# BondLight™ – Tactile Resonance Module

This module is designed to translate the abstract concept of numerical Bond Strength into tangible, luminous patterns. It aims to create a physical manifestation of the Law of Harmonic Amplification, allowing for an intuitive understanding of the underlying frequencies of the number line.

## Project Structure:
- `firmware/`: Embedded code for the BondLight cubes.
- `data/`: Datasets for bond strength mappings and color logic.
- `docs/`: Design documents, theory, and specifications.
- `marketing/`: User scenarios and product messaging.
- `simulations/`: Tools for visualizing waveforms and patterns.

## Purpose:
To provide a tactile and visual interface for exploring the harmonic ontology of mathematics.

# BondLight™ User Scenarios

## 1. Ambient Math Lamp for Harmonic Thinkers
- **Scenario:** A mathematician or enthusiast wants a subtle, dynamic desk accessory that visually reflects the underlying numerical patterns they are contemplating.
- **Interaction:** The BondLight cube (or array of cubes) pulses and shifts colors based on a pre-programmed sequence of numbers, or in response to real-time data from a connected application (e.g., a prime number generator).

## 2. Educational Tool for Numerical Intuition
- **Scenario:** An educator wants to demonstrate abstract mathematical concepts like prime factorization, common multiples, or numerical "energy" in a tangible, engaging way.
- **Interaction:** Students input numbers into a companion app, and the BondLight cube immediately shows the corresponding Bond Strength and prime factor "signature" through its light patterns.

## 3. Meditation and Focus Aid
- **Scenario:** An individual seeks a unique visual anchor for meditation or focused work, leveraging the inherent harmony of numbers.
- **Interaction:** The BondLight cycles through a series of "resonant numbers" (e.g., primorials, highly composite numbers), creating calming, predictable light patterns that aid concentration.
